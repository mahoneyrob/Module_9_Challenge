# Overview
This project was to look at weather in Hawaii for the opening of a surf shop that also will sell ice cream.

## Results
The result show that this business would be sustainable based on the weather on Oahu.  Main finding are:

- The temperatures in both June and December are relatively similar.
- The max temperature on any given day in the months analyzed is 85 in June, and 83 in December.
- The min temperature has a slightly higher spread, with 56 in December and 64 in June.
- The mean temperatures are within a few degrees of each other, 71 in December, and 75 in June.

## Summary
I would conclude that this is a great spot to open this business from a weather prospective.  The temperatures in both months appear to be good for ice cream, and good for surfing.

The one thing I would continue to research are what are the temperatures in other months of the year, as selecting only 2 months could miss something significant.  Also, we should pay attention to precipitation, as it would be my guess that people would not want to surf or eat ice cream during a rain storm.
